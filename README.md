# Linear Regression
A simple linear regression programme which can predict the output by using a list which contains the values of X and its corresponding values of Y.
Anyone can add a set of training data in this programme in a matrix with 2 column (X,Y) and n no. of rows.
The accuracy of the model depends on the size of the dataset.
Hear I usesd a very small dataset, however the programme will also work for a large dataset.
